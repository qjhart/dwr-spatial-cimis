* Greatest accurate (enough) interval

In the process of investigating the current solar calculations, with an eye
towards eliminating the Makefile based processing, I have created two new grass
commands.  [r.iheliosat](https://github.com/qjhart/r.iheliosat) will create some
daily files (like sunrise time) and will also create time integrated clear-sky
solar radiation estimates. Unlike the current setup, this neither requires nor
creates any intermediate files, and as a result is much smaller output than the
current solar calculations.

I have combined this with another new grass command,[[https://github.com/qjhart/g.cimis.daily_solar.git][g.cimis.daily_solar]], which
calculates the cloud masked solar radiation for any day with a mapset following
the Spatial CIMIS standard.  This also produces far less intermediate files, by
default only saving the day’s; Rs, Rso, and K factors, and the surface albedo
for every time in the day.  I’ve verified this works by comparing the output to
the current radiation for a week’s worth of data in July 2024.

These changes allowed me to more easily investigate the impact of the default
daily interval for calculating cloud cover.  We currently include inputs for
every 5 mins of the day, but this is overkill.  The example below shows various
intervals for 20240714.  This was the most clouded July image.  Figure 1 shows
the K factor for this day.

Figure 2 shows the change in K factor as a function of the interval time.
Although this is only one day, we can probably move to a 20 min interval without
incurring too much of a degradation in estimate.  This is important when
considering using an internet source for the GOES data.  This figure was made
with this [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kr1t0HCZ9XF2vggWFrG34bWoOOoXf8_iYswbjcWB_VY/edit?gid=0#gid=0][Google Spreadsheet]], using the CSV files in this directory.  This
summary also appeared in this [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V508hw7eIEtaAAnX54gYhy8AZChMmp1-VO67aUMvJI0/edit?tab=t.0][Google Doc]].
